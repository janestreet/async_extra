(** [pipe1_exn t] returns a pipe of updates from [t] by subscribing to [t].  Closing the
    pipe unsubscribes from [t].  Closing [t] closes the pipe.  [pipe1_exn] raises in the

(** [first_exn here t arity ~f] returns a deferred that becomes determined with value [r]
    when the first event is published to [t] where [f] returns [Some r].  [first_exn] then
    unsubscribes from [t], ensuring that [f] is never called again after it returns
    [Some].  [first_exn] raises if it can't subscribe to the bus, i.e., if [subscribe_exn]
    raises.  If [f] raises, then [first_exn] raises to the monitor in effect when
    [first_exn] was called.  [first_exn] takes time proportional to the number of bus
    subscribers.

    If [stop] is provided and becomes determined, [f] will not be called again, it will
    unsubscribe from the bus, and the deferred that was returned by [first_exn] will never
    become determined. *)
